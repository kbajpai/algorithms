## Technical Questions
- Breadth First vs. Depth First
- Implement an _Interface_
- Difference between an **Abstract Class** & an **Interface**
- Continental Divide Problem
- Huffman Coding
- URL Shortening Service
- Find _k_ biggest numbers in the given array
- Find the shortest path between 2 given words of same lengths so that every word differs from preceding & succeeding word in the path by exactly 1 character
- Design a system that processes events in real-time
- Find frequency of _characters_ in **huge** file (~ 4GB)
- Return the _nth_ digit of the Fibonacci sequence
- Take a string of numbers _12,345_ and return the spoken word version of the number _twelve thousand three hundred forty five_
- _Validate_ a **Binary Search Tree**

### OOPs Concepts
#### Access Modifiers

##### Classes
Modifier      | Class | Package | Subclass | World
------------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | -----
default       |   Y   |   Y     |   N      |   N
public        |   Y   |   Y     |   Y      |   Y
~~protected~~ |   -   |   -     |   -      |   -
~~private~~   |   -   |   -     |   -      |   -

##### Methods
Modifier   | Class | Package | Subclass | World
---------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | -----
default    |   Y   |   Y     |   N      |   N
public     |   Y   |   Y     |   Y      |   Y
protected  |   Y   |   Y     |   Y      |   N
private    |   Y   |   N     |   N      |   N

### General Questions
  - **Distributed Programming** - A concurrent programming language is defined as one which uses the concept of simultaneously executing processes or threads of execution as a means of structuring a program. A parallel language is able to express programs that are executable on more than one processor.
  - **The Bytecode**
  - Garbage Collection
  - Pass by Value/Refernce
  - [Stack vs. Heap](http://www.journaldev.com/4098/java-heap-space-vs-stack-memory)

## Notations
 - **Infix** (Inorder) - Any expression in the standard form like _2 * 3 - 4 / 5_ is an Infix expression
 - **Postfix (Reverse Polish)** - Mathematical notation in which every _operator_ follows all of its _operands_ 
    - NO PARENTHESES
    - 3 4 +
 - **Prefix (Polish)** - Mathematical notation in which every _operator_ is put before their _operands_
    - NO PARENTHESES
    - + 3 4

### Behavioral Questions
- Most challenging project

## Common Java Packages
Name			| Details
----------------| -------------
java.lang 		| Classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java programming language
java.util 		| Contains the collections frame work, legacy collection classes, event model, date and time facilities, internationalization, miscellaneous utility classes (a string tokenizer, a random-number genertor).
java.io 		| System input and output through data streams, serialization and the file system.
java.math 		| Arbitrary-precision integer (BigInteger) and decimal (BigDecimal) arithmetic.
java.text 		| For handling text, dates, numbers, and messages in a manner independent of natural languages.
java.util.regex | Classes for matching character sequences against patterns specified by regular expressions.
